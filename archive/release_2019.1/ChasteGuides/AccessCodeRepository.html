<p>
We offer read-only access to the Chaste repository for anyone. This access is provided with the caveat that the code is always in development (and the <tt>develop</tt>[ment] branch is not guaranteed to be passing all tests), and we will not be able to provide full support for between-release versions of the code. New users should therefore download one of the source releases, or instructions are given here on how to use git to get a released version. If you want to develop Chaste and contribute back to the project you have to use the <tt>develop</tt> branch.
</p>
<p>
The repository uses <a class="ext-link" href="https://git-scm.com/"><span class="icon">​</span>Git</a> to manage code versioning.  You can clone from Git via an IDE plug-in, or by using a command-line client. To create a new directory called Chaste with a copy of the Chaste repository do:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">$ git clone -b develop https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/git/chaste.git Chaste
</pre><p>
Note that this command will setup your local branch to point to the <tt>develop</tt> branch of the remote repository. There are other options:
</p>
<table class="wiki">
<tr><td> <strong>Branch</strong> </td><td> <strong>What it's for</strong> 
</td></tr><tr><td> <tt>develop</tt> </td><td> Bleeding-edge development code, new feature (ticket) branches should branch off here to minimise conflicts 
</td></tr><tr><td> <tt>passed_continuous</tt> </td><td> latest code that passed continuous tests and isn't disastrous 
</td></tr><tr><td> <tt>passed_nightly</tt> </td><td> latest code that passed above tests, plus some longer nightly ones including coverage and memory testing 
</td></tr><tr><td> <tt>passed_portability</tt> </td><td> latest code that passed above tests, plus our suite of tests for different dependency versions 
</td></tr><tr><td> <tt>master</tt> </td><td> Latest release-candidate quality code that has passed all above tests plus weekly ones 
</td></tr><tr><td> <tt>release</tt> </td><td> Latest released code - updated roughly every 6 months 
</td></tr><tr><td> Release Tags </td><td> Released code for a certain Chaste version (e.g. v3.4), also accessible from <a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/Chaste/Chaste"><span class="icon">​</span>https://github.com/Chaste/Chaste</a> with nice instructions!

<p>
Which branch you use is up to you, if you are using Chaste for the basis of a paper we'd suggest either using:
</p>
<ul><li><tt>master</tt> --- you might have to wait a few months for an official release, but will get most of the latest features; or
</li><li><tt>release</tt> for the latest full release of Chaste. Past releases are all tagged in the git repository, or you can download them from the main Chaste website. 
</li></ul><p>
To get the latest release via the source code do the above <tt>git clone</tt> command then:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">cd Chaste
git checkout release
</pre><p>
To get a past release via the source code do the above <tt>git clone</tt> command then:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">cd Chaste
git tag
</pre><p>
This will list all available release tags. It should be evident which is which and you can get a copy with e.g.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">git checkout tags/release_3.4

You can also <a href="https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/register">register for a Chaste wiki account</a> (recommended for creating and commenting on tickets of work).
